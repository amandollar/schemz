1️⃣ Project One-Liner (OPEN WITH THIS)

> A rule-based eligibility matching platform that dynamically maps user profiles to government schemes using admin-defined criteria without backend code changes.

3️⃣ Core Innovation (THIS IS THE HEART)

❌ Hardcoded conditions
✅ Rule-based eligibility engine

Eligibility logic is stored as data, not code.


---

4️⃣ Data Models (Locked & Final)

User

{
  name,
  email,
  age,
  income,
  category,
  education,
  gender,
  state,
  disability,
  occupation,
  maritalStatus,
  residenceType, // Urban/Rural
  employmentType, // Gov, Private, Unemployed
  bplStatus // Boolean
}

Scheme

{
  name,
  description,
  benefits,
  ministry,
  active,
  rules: [RuleId]
}

Rule

{
  field: "income",
  operator: "<=",
  value: 250000,
  weight: 25
}


---

5️⃣ Admin → Scheme Creation Flow

1. Admin logs in


2. Creates scheme (name, benefits, ministry)


3. Adds multiple eligibility rules via form


4. Saves scheme as Draft


5. Publishes scheme



👉 No backend change needed for new schemes


---

6️⃣ Matching Engine Logic (FINAL)

Rule Evaluation

evaluate(user[field], operator, value)

Scoring

match % = (matchedRuleWeights / totalRuleWeights) × 100

Output

[
  { "scheme": "PM Awas Yojana", "match": 91 },
  { "scheme": "PM Scholarship", "match": 74 }
]


---

7️⃣ Backend Structure (DO NOT CHANGE)

backend/
 ├─ models/
 ├─ controllers/
 ├─ routes/
 ├─ services/
 │   └─ eligibilityEngine.js
 ├─ middleware/
 └─ server.js

📌 eligibilityEngine.js = brain of project


---

8️⃣ APIs (Minimal & Strong)

User

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

GET /schemes/match


Admin

POST /admin/scheme

PUT /admin/scheme/:id

POST /admin/scheme/:id/publish



---

9️⃣ Frontend Pages

User

Login / Register

Profile Form

Eligible Schemes List (ranked)


Admin

Login

Add Scheme

Add Rules

Dashboard (basic stats)



---

🔐 10️⃣ Security

JWT authentication

Role-based middleware

/admin/* protected routes



---

11️⃣ Time Complexity (Say This Confidently)

> Matching runs in O(S × R)
S = number of schemes
R = rules per scheme




---

12️⃣ What Makes This Project DIFFERENT

Data-driven eligibility

Admin-controlled policy logic

Scoring-based matching

Extensible architecture

Real-world government use case



---

13️⃣ Viva Kill Lines (MEMORIZE)

“Eligibility is configurable, not hardcoded”

“Policy changes don’t require redeployment”

“Matching is probabilistic, not binary”

“This is a rule engine, not a CRUD app”


14️⃣ Build Order (FAST)
